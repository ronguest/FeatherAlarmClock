Feather Alarm Clock
========

* This is based on a Feather M0 WINC1500, Adafruit Music Maker Feather Wing and and the 7 segment display wing
* The audio file is stored on the SD card of the Music Maker

* An alarm time of 0000 is a disabled alarm
* An alarm time of 9999 means to continuously sound the alarm

* It requires a URL (php assumed) on a server that returns the alarm time as 4 digits in 24 hour time (e.g. 0600 for 6am)

* It requires a WiFi connection

* Both are configured in alarm_setup. An example is provided since this info should not be made public
